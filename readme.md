## What is Passcloud?

For most people, passwords are a real problem. Remembering passwords is a pain and using the same password everywhere will eventually lead to a disaster. While traditional password managers solve this with lots of random passwords they have to save your passwords in their databases.

**This makes your passwords vulnerable to interception and hacking!**

Passcloud attempts to solve this problem by _never storing your passwords_. Instead, Passcloud generates pseudo-random passwords based on the [Mersenne Twister PRNG algorithm](http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/emt.html). Passcloud uses this stateless algorithm to free the user from relying on storage methods for their secrets. Users can combine the same repeatable information based on a master password and always get the same unique password.

By using Passcloud for every site you visit you're less vulnerable to security breaches, even if one password is compromised all of your other passwords generated by Passcloud remains secure!

## Nothing to Hack

With Passcloud there is nothing to intercept since it uses client-side JavaScript. Unless you choose to use the convenient sync feature you will never send sensitive data across a network. Even with the sync feature enabled Passcloud is one of the most secure password managers available. 

Since your generated passwords aren't saved to your device, there is no risk you'll be forced to divulge them to aggressive peers. And since these passwords don't need to be backed up or synchronized between devices over the network,there is no risk of them getting intercepted.

Finally, Passcloud is free software (GPLv3), its algorithm extensively documented and does not require you to trust any external party. This is particularly interesting in a society where things like PRISM and gag orders are a real threat.

## Always In Sync

No cloud provider to trust, no backups to maintain and no data connection for keeping in sync. Contrary to other password solutions, Passcloud doesn't need to send your passwords over the network to make them ubiquitously available.

Since Passcloud generates your passwords on-demand based on your information and master password, you don't have any of these fragile dependencies. Just add your information into each of your devices and your passwords will be available instantly on all of them.

This gives you massive availability advantages, but also helps thwart man-in-the-middle attacks, snooping and trust issues related to cloud providers.

## Convenience of Sync

We know sometimes convenience trumps security. To solve this Passcloud uses Google Firebase to anonymously sync [NAME FOR DATA]. This is an optional feature. All one needs to do not to use it is simply not use it. Avoid the SYNC and SAVE buttons and you'll never send any data across a network.

### What data is stored?

Passcloud stores only the [NAME FOR DATA] used to generate your passwords. Without the use of your user key and a masterpassword the site specific data is unaccessible and unreadable. Since the [NAME FOR DATA] is anonymized and encrypted using AES256 a data breach wouldn't expose a user to any risk. There is simply no way to extract useful data from our stored Google Firebase.

## For Any Purpose

Passcloud comes with a variety of built-in password types. These types make your password look different, become more secure or more compatible with a site's password policy.
Passcloud also implements a solution that allows you to save custom information in the app. This information is AES encrypted using a large key derived from your master password.
